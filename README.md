Smart Energy Project 1

Android sample project "Activity Recognition": https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-location/tree/master/ActivityRecognition


Ideas for App:
- detect elevator usage (instead of taking the stairs) by using accelerometer in z-direction.
- use https://transport.opendata.ch/docs.html or/and https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/vbz_fahrplandaten_gtfs to make better differentiations between tram/bus/car usage.
